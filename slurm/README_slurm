Run haplotype genotyper
Two scripts are requires:
/home/vitisgen/tools/amplicon_slurm.py
/home/vitisgen/tools/run_cutadapt.py

1. Prepare a text file with plate list, one plate name per line
2. On cbsudesktop04, run this command. It would create a directory "dataDir" with all fastq files, as well as sample and primer file
/home/vitisgen/tools/queryFastq.pl -o dataDir -t rhampseq -l plateList.txt -f

3. Prepare slurm cluster
Reserve computers as needed.
From one of the reserved computer node, run this command to create a slurm cluster. the slurm cluste is named after the first computer name.
manage_slurm new computer1,computer2,...computerN

4. On cbsudesktop04, 
cd dataDir
/home/vitisgen/tools/run_cutadapt.py -s sampleFile -k keyFile -x theNamepfTheCluster -o output -c 10 -n 10 -m 1000 -a 0.00005 -l 150 -d 0 -r 20 -y 20

copy the slurm.sh created in the output directory to the first computer node.

5. on the first computer node, run
sbatch slurm.sh

6. after this is done, kill the cluster, and cancel reservation from the biohpc web site.
manage_slurm kill computer1

7. going back to cbsudesktop04, and continue with step2 and 3 of the pipeline, with this command:
/home/vitisgen/tools/run_cutadapt.py -s sampleFile -k keyFile -i 1 -o output -c 10 -n 10 -m 1000 -a 0.00005 -l 150 -d 0 -r 20 -y 20

END


keep sample file, key file, and fastq.gz files in the same directory
2. from this directory,  produce a slurm batch file from the directory where the fastq files are located. the batch file is slurm.sh in the output directory
 ~/amplicon/amplicon_slurm.py -s sampleFile -k keyFile  -x cbsum1c2b012 -y 10 -t 1 -o output -d 0
**** this script is restartable, it will produce slurmSamples files which only contain samples not in the tagBySampleDir directory

It will prompt a sbatch command for you to run manually. 
If all done, run this same command will proceed to next step.a


Run gatk
Two scripts are requires:
/home/vitisgen/tools/amplicon_gatk_slurm.py
/home/vitisgen/tools/run_gatk.py

~/vitisgen/tools/amplicon_gatk_slurm.py -s sampleFile -o output -r rhampseq_db  -m 25 -t 1 -d 0 -i 2 -x cbsum1c2b012 -x 10

The bam files are filtered by alignment scores, 5' and 3' clipping length (defined by -m, default 25)

alignment score / read length > 0.7. roughly equivalent to 7% edit distance, and incorporating indels.
